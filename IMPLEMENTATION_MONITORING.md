# Service Monitoring and Integrity Checks Implementation Summary

## Issue #37 - Complete

This document summarizes the implementation of file system monitoring and integrity check services as specified in issue #37.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Configuration Updates
- **File**: `src/VivaldiModManager.Service/appsettings.json`
- Added monitoring configuration:
  - `MonitoringDebounceMs`: 2000 (2 seconds)
  - `IntegrityCheckIntervalSeconds`: 60
  - `IntegrityCheckStaggeringEnabled`: true
  - `MaxConsecutiveFailures`: 5

- **File**: `src/VivaldiModManager.Service/Configuration/ServiceConfiguration.cs`
- Added properties with validation for monitoring settings

### 2. Background Services

#### FileSystemMonitorService
- **File**: `src/VivaldiModManager.Service/BackgroundServices/FileSystemMonitorService.cs`
- **Features**:
  - Watches ModsRootPath for .js file changes
  - Watches all managed Vivaldi installation paths (resources/vivaldi folder)
  - 2-second debounce for rapid changes
  - Filters temporary files (.tmp, .bak, .swp, ~)
  - Publishes FileChanged and VivaldiChanged events
  - Respects GlobalSettings.MonitoringEnabled flag
  - Pause/resume functionality
  - Statistics tracking: TotalFileChanges, TotalVivaldiChanges, LastChangeTime
  - Proper error handling and logging

#### IntegrityCheckService
- **File**: `src/VivaldiModManager.Service/BackgroundServices/IntegrityCheckService.cs`
- **Features**:
  - Runs periodic checks every 60 seconds (configurable)
  - Staggers checks across installations to avoid load spikes
  - Verifies injection stubs are present in target files
  - Checks fingerprints match expected values
  - Verifies loader.js exists
  - Verifies all enabled mod files exist
  - Tracks consecutive failure counts per installation
  - Publishes IntegrityViolation events
  - Skips checks when Safe Mode is active
  - Skips checks when AutoHealEnabled is false
  - Statistics tracking: TotalChecksRun, TotalViolationsDetected, LastCheckTime
  - Escalating log levels based on failure count

### 3. Models
- **File**: `src/VivaldiModManager.Service/Models/MonitoringStatus.cs`
- Response model for GetMonitoringStatus IPC command
- Contains all monitoring and integrity check statistics

### 4. Service Registration
- **File**: `src/VivaldiModManager.Service/Program.cs`
- Both services registered as:
  - Singletons (for dependency injection)
  - IHostedServices (for automatic startup)

### 5. IPC Server Updates
- **File**: `src/VivaldiModManager.Service/Services/IPCServerService.cs`
- Injected FileSystemMonitorService and IntegrityCheckService
- Added command handlers:
  - `GetMonitoringStatus`: Returns monitoring statistics
  - `PauseMonitoring`: Stops file watchers
  - `ResumeMonitoring`: Restarts file watchers
- Updated `GetHealthCheck` to include:
  - monitoringActive status
  - integrityCheckActive status

### 6. Tests
- **File**: `tests/VivaldiModManager.Service.Tests/BackgroundServices/FileSystemMonitorServiceTests.cs`
  - 11 tests covering constructor validation, startup behavior, pause/resume, statistics
  
- **File**: `tests/VivaldiModManager.Service.Tests/BackgroundServices/IntegrityCheckServiceTests.cs`
  - 12 tests covering constructor validation, startup behavior, staggering, statistics

- **File**: `tests/VivaldiModManager.Service.Tests/Services/IPCServerServiceTests.cs`
  - Updated to inject new services (pre-existing tests continue to work)

**Test Results**: All 23 new tests pass ✓

### 7. Documentation
- **File**: `docs/service/README.md`
- Added comprehensive documentation:
  - Configuration options with descriptions and recommendations
  - Monitoring behavior and limitations
  - Integrity checks with staggering explanation
  - Event documentation with examples
  - IPC command documentation for monitoring commands
  - Statistics explanation
  - Troubleshooting guide with monitoring-specific sections
  - Resource usage and performance considerations

## Build Status
✓ Solution builds successfully with no errors (only pre-existing warnings)

## Key Features Implemented

### File System Monitoring
- ✓ Watches mods directory recursively for .js files
- ✓ Watches each Vivaldi installation's resources/vivaldi folder
- ✓ 2-second debounce prevents event flooding
- ✓ Filters temporary files automatically
- ✓ Publishes events for consumption
- ✓ Respects manifest settings
- ✓ Pause/resume via IPC
- ✓ Statistics tracking
- ✓ Graceful error handling

### Integrity Checks
- ✓ Periodic checks every 60 seconds
- ✓ Staggered checking for 3+ installations
- ✓ Verifies injection stubs exist
- ✓ Checks fingerprint matches
- ✓ Validates loader.js exists
- ✓ Confirms enabled mods exist
- ✓ Tracks consecutive failures per installation
- ✓ Publishes violation events
- ✓ Skips when safe mode active
- ✓ Skips when auto-heal disabled
- ✓ Escalating log levels

### IPC Integration
- ✓ GetMonitoringStatus returns detailed statistics
- ✓ PauseMonitoring stops watchers
- ✓ ResumeMonitoring restarts watchers
- ✓ GetHealthCheck includes monitoring status

## Events Published
Ready for consumption by auto-heal service (#38):

1. **FileChanged**: Mod file changed (after debounce)
2. **VivaldiChanged**: Vivaldi installation file changed (after debounce)
3. **IntegrityViolation**: Violation detected with details and consecutive failure count

## Performance Characteristics
- **Memory**: ~1-2 MB per FileSystemWatcher (one per installation)
- **CPU**: Negligible - kernel-level notifications, debounced processing
- **Typical Usage**: 1-3 installations = minimal impact
- **5+ Installations**: Still efficient, documented in troubleshooting

## Limitations Documented
- FileSystemWatcher may not work on network drives
- Antivirus software may interfere
- Path length limits (~260 chars)
- Duplicate events possible (handled by debouncing)

## Prerequisites Verified
✓ Issue #36 service infrastructure is complete and functional
✓ Service builds successfully
✓ IPC communication working
✓ Manifest service available

## Next Steps (Issue #38)
The auto-heal service can now subscribe to:
- FileChanged events
- VivaldiChanged events  
- IntegrityViolation events

And consume monitoring status via:
- GetMonitoringStatus IPC command
- GetHealthCheck IPC command (includes monitoring status)
