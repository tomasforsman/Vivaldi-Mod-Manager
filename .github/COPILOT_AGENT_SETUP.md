# GitHub Copilot Agent Setup

This document explains the GitHub Copilot Agent configuration for the Vivaldi Mod Manager repository.

## What Was Fixed

The GitHub Copilot Agent was not working due to missing workflow permissions and configuration. The following changes were made:

### 1. Updated CI Workflow Permissions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
Added the following permissions to enable Copilot Agent interaction:
- `contents: read` - Allow reading repository contents
- `pull-requests: write` - Allow writing to pull requests
- `issues: write` - Allow writing to issues  
- `actions: read` - Allow reading workflow actions

### 2. Added Copilot Agent Support Workflow (`.github/workflows/copilot-agent.yml`)
Created a dedicated workflow that responds to:
- Pull request events (opened, synchronized, reopened)
- Pull request reviews
- Issue comments
- Pull request review comments

### 3. Added Copilot Agent Configuration (`.github/copilot-agent.yml`)
Created configuration file with:
- Agent permissions and capabilities
- Event triggers
- Behavior settings

### 4. Added Repository Settings (`.github/settings.yml`)
Configured repository settings to support GitHub Apps and Copilot Agent interactions.

### 5. Added Diagnostics Workflow (`.github/workflows/copilot-diagnostics.yml`)
Created a diagnostic workflow to help troubleshoot Copilot Agent issues.

### 6. Updated Templates
Enhanced the pull request template with Copilot Agent usage guidance.

## How to Use GitHub Copilot Agent

### In Pull Requests
- @mention `@copilot` in pull request comments to request assistance
- Ask for code reviews, suggestions, or implementation help
- Request automated testing or validation

### In Issues  
- Use the "Copilot Agent Task" issue template for structured requests
- Provide clear task descriptions and expected outcomes
- Include relevant context and constraints

### Example Requests
```
@copilot can you review this pull request and suggest improvements?

@copilot please help implement unit tests for the VivaldiService class

@copilot can you check if this code follows the project's coding standards?
```

## Troubleshooting

If the Copilot Agent is still not responding:

1. Check that the repository has GitHub Copilot enabled
2. Verify that the GitHub App has the necessary permissions
3. Run the diagnostics workflow manually from the Actions tab
4. Check the workflow logs for permission errors

## Testing the Setup

To test if the Copilot Agent is working:

1. Create a pull request
2. Add a comment mentioning `@copilot` with a simple request
3. The agent should respond within a few minutes
4. Check the Actions tab for workflow execution

## Additional Configuration

The repository is now configured with:
- ✅ Proper workflow permissions
- ✅ Event triggers for agent responses  
- ✅ Configuration files for agent behavior
- ✅ Diagnostic tools for troubleshooting
- ✅ Updated templates with usage guidance

The GitHub Copilot Agent should now be able to interact with pull requests and respond to requests for assistance.
