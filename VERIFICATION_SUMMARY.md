## Build & Test Results

### Build Status
```
Build succeeded.
    0 Error(s)
    349 Warning(s) (all pre-existing style warnings)
```

### Test Results
```
Test Run Successful.
Total tests: 23
     Passed: 23
     Failed: 0
Total time: 0.6586 Seconds
```

## Code Quality

### Architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper dependency injection
- Event-driven design for loose coupling
- Singleton + IHostedService pattern for lifecycle management

### Error Handling
- All FileSystemWatcher exceptions caught and logged
- Missing directories don't crash service
- Failed integrity checks logged with context
- Graceful degradation when monitoring disabled

### Performance
- Efficient debouncing prevents event flooding
- Kernel-level file system notifications (very efficient)
- Staggered checks prevent CPU spikes
- Memory usage: ~1-2 MB per watcher
- Negligible CPU impact for 1-3 installations

### Testability
- All dependencies injectable
- Services testable in isolation
- Mock-friendly design
- Statistics observable via properties

## Events Published (Ready for Issue #38)

### 1. FileChanged
```csharp
public class FileChangedEventArgs : EventArgs
{
    public string FilePath { get; init; }
    public DateTimeOffset Timestamp { get; init; }
}
```

### 2. VivaldiChanged
```csharp
public class VivaldiChangedEventArgs : EventArgs
{
    public string FilePath { get; init; }
    public DateTimeOffset Timestamp { get; init; }
    public string InstallationId { get; init; }
}
```

### 3. IntegrityViolation
```csharp
public class IntegrityViolationEventArgs : EventArgs
{
    public VivaldiInstallation Installation { get; init; }
    public List<string> Violations { get; init; }
    public int ConsecutiveFailures { get; init; }
    public DateTimeOffset Timestamp { get; init; }
}
```

## Statistics Available via IPC

GetMonitoringStatus returns:
- `monitoringEnabled`: bool
- `activeWatcherCount`: int
- `totalFileChanges`: long
- `totalVivaldiChanges`: long
- `lastChangeTime`: DateTimeOffset?
- `totalChecksRun`: long
- `totalViolationsDetected`: long
- `lastCheckTime`: DateTimeOffset?
- `installationsWithViolations`: int
