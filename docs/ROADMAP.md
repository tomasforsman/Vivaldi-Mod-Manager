# Roadmap
- Mod sync/backup: Plan incremental mod syncing and scheduled backups for managed installations.
- More examples: Expand the docs/examples catalog with scripts for common workflows (UI tweaks, automation, etc.).
- Configuration interface: Design a settings view that exposes manifest options (paths, safe mode toggles, retention policies).
- CSS mod support: Allow adding and managing CSS mods alongside JavaScript (file management, ordering, preview).
